    <p>
        Since December 2023, the British Royal Air Force have repeatedly flown Shadow R1 intelligence gathering planes
        from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus over the occupied Gaza Strip. The flights leave Akrotiri, turning off their
        transponders some 100 miles from the Gaza Strip, before returning several hours later. Intelligence gathered
        during these flights has been shared with the Israeli government, under the notion of 'locating the remaining
        hostages.' However, no public clarification has been given as to the nature of the intelligence being shared,
        with concerns being raised that it may be used to assist with war crimes during Israel's genocidal onslaught in
        Gaza. This website aims to automatically collect data on these flights from publicly available sources, and
        compile it in one place.
